# Hi, I'm Abraham ðŸ‘‹

I am currently an undergraduate student who is passionate in mathematics, art, and computer science. Some programming languages I am working right now includes Python, Javascript, and C++. I also have experience working with markup languages such as HTML and CSS. 

Whenever I am not working on my personal projects, I enjoy reading classic books, making artworks, learning new languages (Japanese and Mandarin), and even trying some advanced math problems.

Working on exploring data analysis on a chocolate rating dataset for future predictions and statistical methods.
